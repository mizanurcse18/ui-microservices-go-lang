I believe the existing hardcoded menu configuration from menu.config.tsx is still being displayed in the left sidebar instead of the dynamic menu data that should be fetched from the API endpoint. The dynamic menu loading feature that was implemented should be fetching menu data from the API after login, but it appears the static MENU_SIDEBAR configuration is still taking precedence. Please investigate why the API call to fetch dynamic menus isn't working properly or why the hardcoded menu is still being displayed instead of the API-provided menu data. The dynamic menu should replace the hardcoded menu after successful login, with fallback to the static menu if the API call fails.
